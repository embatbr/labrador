## Build and install

Before installing, make sure you are in the correct environment and go to the project root directory (the one in which this README file is contained). The ideal is to create a virtual environment:

```bash
$ mkvirtualenv --python=$(which python3.6) <YOUR_ENVNAME>
```

After that, activate your environment and install the package.

```bash
$ workon <YOUR_ENVNAME>
$ python setup.py install
```
